    <h1>Our problems and the solutions we came up with</h1>
    <p>
        In this section we will talk about the difficulties we have faced,
        and how we supported each other through the though times in order to find a solution to our problems.
        <br> <br>
        For the moment, we have not faced unsurmountable problems. Although we have faced challenges,
        we have, until now, always been able to find solution relatively quickly,
        which is something that we, as a group, are grateful for.
