    <h1>Our problems and the solutions we came up with</h1>
    <p>
        In this section we will talk about the difficulties we have faced,
        and how we supported each other through the though times in order to find a solution to our problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Human problems</h2>
    <p>
        During this period, the group has had to face some difficulties linked to morale.
        However, our team spirit enabled us to get through hard times,
        and we, as a group, and for some, even as individuals, are stronger for it.
        The way we supported each other is a good lesson for our futures.
        Indeed, once we become engineers, we will probably have to manage a team,
        and good communication skills, as well as team spirit, will be great assets.
    </p>
    <h2>Coding problems</h2>
    <p>
        We have tackled more complex functions these past few months.
        Thus, we have faced more difficulties, and sometimes, one member of the group alone
         could not find a solution.
        There again, the support of our team mates was key for us to unlock difficult situations.
