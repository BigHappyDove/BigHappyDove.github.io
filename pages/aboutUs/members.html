    <h1>The Members</h1>
    <h2>Titouan GUIONNEAU</h2>
    <p> I started programming a long time ago, with small Python programs.
        I have also done quite a lot of LUA on Garry’s Mod in order to create game modes and addons.
        Teamwork is familiar to me in the computing domain,
        as I have already participated in group programming projects.
        I truly hope that we will be capable to create a wonderful project! <br> <br>
        I have been given the added responsibility of being the team leader.
        I will take this opportunity as a way to learn how to manage a project including multiple members. <br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Clovis LECHIEN</h2>
    <p>
        I started to get interested in the programming world in middle school.
        Like most children my age, I was obsessed with video games.
        However, it is in high school that I felt the need to explore this world further.
        The “ISN” speciality was thus a good compromise to initiate myself to both programming and teamwork. <br><br>
        As you may have noticed while reading my summary, I am a beginner in programming.
        However, I aim to turn this weakness into a strength, by utilizing my growing curiosity for this domain. <br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Jacques REMY</h2>
    <p>
        Ever since my youngest age, I have had the ambition to dedicate my career to digital professions.
        I quickly understood that an engineering diploma would be necessary to obtain this objective. <br><br>
        Sensitized to computing early on, I started to learn Python and C++.
        Led by simple curiosity at first,
        I quickly became passionate about this subject and wanted to develop my knowledge further.
        This led to my choice to take the “ISN” speciality for my senior year,
        during which I did my first group project in JAVA. <br><br>
        Aside from my appetite for IT, I am an open-minded person, a friendly peer.
        My personal balance is linked to my practice of theatre, sports and scouting.
        Teamwork should, therefore, not be an issue. <br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Lilas REYNAUD</h2>
    <p>
        I had never truly explored the depth of IT before starting school at EPITA this year,
        but it has always been an interesting domain to me. Being a very curious person,
        having explored multiple areas, whether it be in arts or sciences,
        computing engineering is to me a wonderful opportunity to link creativity and scientific knowledge. <br> <br>
        Thus, despite my lack of experience in programming,
        I hope that my curiosity and motivation will enable me to be an effective member of our project’s team.
