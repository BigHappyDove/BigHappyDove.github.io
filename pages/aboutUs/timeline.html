    <h1>The Timeline of our project</h1>
    <h2>Until February:</h2>
    <p>
        In comparison to what we had originally planned at the beginning of the project,
        we rapidly realized that some of our objectives were not realistic.
        Indeed, some elements are too dependant on the advancement of other founding functions.
        For example, the HUD interface needs to be implemented on relatively functional mini-games.
        And for the games to be functioning entities, we first needed to create strong mechanic and multiplayer foundations.  <br>
        <br>
        Putting aside some aspects of our planning allowed us to focus on other parts, which are actually in advance,
        compared to our plans. Therefore, we are overall quite please with the current state of our project.
        Indeed, despite the changes that we had to make, our game now has solid foundations,
        on which we can now serenely build during the rest of the second semester.
    </p>
    <h2>From February to April:</h2>
    <p>
        During this period of the project, we have faced both human and developing challenges.
        This led us to adapt our group strategy. However, as a group, we managed to stay efficient.
        Indeed, despite some unexpected disruptions, we have built a functional game.
        Although it is not at its final state yet, we can be proud of the progress that has been made by BigHappyDove.
    </p>
    <h2>From April until the end of the project:</h2>
    <p>
        This last period of work was perhaps the most important one.
        Indeed, after June, we will not have another chance to update our game.
        Therefore, every single aspect of the project needs to be completed in time.
        Not only did we need to advance concerning the technical side, enabling a fluid gameplay;
        but we also had to make great progress on the aesthetic aspect.
        In order to truly be completed, Party Blowout! needs to appeal to our player's eye.
        Thus, these were what we focused on, for the final part of our time working together with the BigHappyDove team.
