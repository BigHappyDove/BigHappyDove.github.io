    <h1>The Timeline of our project</h1>
    <p>
        In comparison to what we had originally planned at the beginning of the project,
        we rapidly realized that some of our objectives were not realistic.
        Indeed, some elements are too dependant on the advancement of other founding functions.
        For example, the HUD interface needs to be implemented on relatively functional mini-games.
        And for the games to be functioning entities, we first needed to create strong mechanic and multiplayer foundations.  <br>
        <br>
        Putting aside some aspects of our planning allowed us to focus on other parts, which are actually in advance,
        compared to our plans. Therefore, we are overall quite please with the current state of our project.
        Indeed, despite the changes that we had to make, our game now has solid foundations,
        on which we can now serenely build during the rest of the second semester.
